            </h1>

                <h4>
                    <p> Greetings, I am from the city of <span>Prattville, AL</span> as technology has revolved around me since a kid. I was always the <span>"fix-it"</span> person when the applicances around the house were not working corectly. This sparked my interest in this field as I was always curious on how certain devices <span>behave</span> and <span>interact</span> with one another. Then, in high school, I enrolled into a computer science class and instantly fell in love. My <span>passion</span> for electronics and computer programming came to life as I progressed through the course and experienced first-hand how <span>important</span> technology is to our society. Fast forward to my senior year in high school, I was conflicting between enrolling into Alabama or Auburn. I grew up in a Alabama football-loving family so that was , of course, my first option. However, as I began to do more research on the two respective institutions, I found how <span>brillant</span> and <span>innovative</span> the college of Auburn is as they have recieved several <span>nationwide recoginitions</span> for being a top-tier institution. So, I made my decision to become a Auburn engineer and chant <span>"War Eagle !"</span> along with my fellow classmates in the <span>electric</span> field of Jordan-Hare Stadium. I never thought for a moment of regretting my decision and going to another school. This place has given me a place to call <span>home</span> as the friends, connections, memories, and the lessons I have learned are unexhangeable. So, as I draw closer to ending this chapter in my life, I am <span>prepared</span> to step forward into a <span><em>new</em></span> chapter and experience things I have never experienced before. Thank you for tuning in to learn a little more about myself and my inspirations!</p>
